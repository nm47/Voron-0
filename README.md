![Image of Voron Zero](http://vorondesign.com/images/voron0.1_bg.jpg)

This is a backup of the CAD/setup of my Voron 0 3d printer.  You can find the original Voron 0 on located at the [Voron Design]( http://vorondesign.com/voron0) website.

The current revision is V0.1.

Below are the modifications I have made, a majority of the parts remain unchanged.

**Toolhead/Extruder**
- Bowden toolhead (I prefer the look of the bowden toolhead on the 0.1, so I have reverted back to that).
- M4 extruder (I had issues with the poketwatch, and prefer the design of the M4).

**Drive units**
- A/B steppers remain the V0.0 BOM steppers, I will upgrade these one day, but eh..
- Motor panel mount has been replaced by an umbilical PCB to make wiring cleaner/reduce strain on connections to the SKR board.

**Frame**
- No changes

**Electronics**
- Added mounts for LED sticks below the gantry.
- Added a mount for a raspberry pi camera v2.1.
- Raspberry Pi and SKR relocated to accomodate the M4.

**Tophat**
- No changes

**Front Idlers**
- No changes
